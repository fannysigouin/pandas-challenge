    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis of PyCity Schools provides various insights both at the district level and at the school level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## District Summary\n",
    "The District Summary analysis (contained in the district_summary dataframe) provides an overview of the district's key metrics: total schools, total students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, percentage of students who passed math, percentage of students who passed reading, and percentage of students who passed both math and reading. This overview shows that while the average scores and the individual passing rates for math and reading are high, the percentage of students who passed both math and reading is relatively low.\n",
    "\n",
    "## School Summary\n",
    "The School Summary analysis (contained in the per_school_summary dataframe) provides a summary of key metrics for each school. This includes the type of school, its total number of students, its total budget and budget per student, the averages of math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and math and reading. \n",
    "### Highest Performing and Lowest Performing Schools\n",
    "From this summary, a further analysis was done to identify the top 5 and the bottom 5 performing schools, based on the percentage of students who are passing both math and reading. The top 5 schools have various budgets and total students, but the key trend is that they are all charter schools (as opposed to district schools). Meanwhile, the bottom 5 schools have significantly higher budgets and a greater total number of students. The 5 bottom schools are all district schools (as opposed to charter schools). This would indicate that charter schools perform better than district schools.\n",
    "### Math and Reading Scores by Grade\n",
    "The math and reading scores were also analyzed by grade to identify trends across each school. Students from each school generally have similar average scores across all grades. These results are summarized in two dataframes: math_scores_by_grade and reading_scores_by_grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scores by School Spending\n",
    "This analysis categorizes each school's per student budget into 4 bins, or ranges of spending, to then analyze the average scores and passing rates based on the school's spending. The results are summarized in the spending_summary dataframe and show that lower spending schools tend to have higher average scores and passing rates, which would indicate that more spending does not necessarily correlate with higher scores or passing rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scores by School Size\n",
    "This analysis categorizes each school's size into 3 bins, or ranges of size, to then analyze the average scores and passing rates based on the school's size. The results are summarized in the size_summary dataframe and show that smaller and medium schools of less than 2,000 students have higher averages and passing rates than large schools of over 2,000 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scores by School Type\n",
    "This final analysis compares the average scores and the passing rates of charter schools and district schools. The results are summarized in the type_summary dataframe and show that charter schools have higher average scores and passing rates than district schools."
